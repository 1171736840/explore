Chrome is the most popular web browser worldwide as of mid-2017, made by the tech company Google. It's available for most operating systems including Windows, macOS, and Linux and on multiple platforms such as the desktop, phones, and tablets.

Chrome boasts a minimalistic UI and was the first browser to feature "tabs" above the address bar, a convention that was later implemented in other browsers. Other popular features include things such as Incognito mode, tab sandboxing, and a Web Store with extensions and themes.

Although Chrome is not open source, the majority of the source code is available under the Chromium moniker.


发现一个Chrome的bug，本地同时运行两个web站点，A站点tomcat6.0端口80，和B站点9.0端口8080，访问A站点后B站点session会丢失，访问B站点A站点的session也会丢失，换edge浏览器就问题

这样运行一段时间后浏览器越来越卡（360极速浏览器，Chrome还没用那么长时间），打字都卡，重启浏览器没用，只能重启电脑

This section uses Google Translate:
Found a Chrome bug, running two web sites at the same time, A site tomcat6.0 port 80, and B site 9.0 port 8080, B site session will be lost after accessing site A, session accessing site B site will also be lost, Change the edge browser to the problem

After running for a while, the browser is getting more and more cards (360 speed browser, Chrome has not been used for so long), typing cards, restarting the browser is useless, can only restart the computer
